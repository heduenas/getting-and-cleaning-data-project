==========
In this project we produced a reduced, tidy version of UCI Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset.

==========
The file script file run_alaysis.R takes the UCI Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset as input and produces an output file named 'tidy_data.txt' as output on the working directory. This structure of the tidy data file is described in the file CodeBook.md.
